# solr-troubleshooting-framework
Repository for the Solr troubleshooting framework. Small project aimed to learn Apache Solr debugging.

I started this project while working as a Search Engineer @lucidworks. The idea is to have a simple but useful tool to start troubleshooting issues within the Apache Solr software.
At this moment the codebase is very small since its just a side project that i'm working on and also it's helping me improve my Python programming skills.

I would love to hear any critics and feedback from the community as well as suggestions and collaboration.
